# Aegis All in One Mapping Solution

## Introduction

This repository is meant to help newbies to give their first steps into the Pok√©mon Mapping world using Aegis (https://www.pokemod.dev) and the Unown# (https://github.com/UnownHash) stack.

For people rather interested in Atlas (https://www.pokemod.dev) and RDM (https://github.com/RealDeviceMap), you should head over to our other repository (https://github.com/The-Pokemod-Group/Atlas-All-In-One)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/The-Pokemod-Group/Aegis-All-In-One.git
```

### 2. Copy the configuration files

```
cd aegis-all-in-one
cp .env-default .env
cp docker-compose-default.yaml docker-compose.yaml
```

### 3. Edit the config files to your liking. Pay special attention to the Api secrets inside the .env file

Make sure ApiKeys and Passwords match in the following places:

- .env
- reactmap/local.json
- unown/dragonite_config.toml
- unown/golbat_config.toml
- unown/rotom_config.json (AuthBearer for Aegis Devices)

### 4. Start the stack

```
sudo docker-compose up -d --force-recreate --build
```

You should check each running container for errors after first start in the form of:

```
sudo docker logs <name_of_container>
```

It's normal that after the first start some errors appear as, for example, koji needs to have
at least one project for dragonite/reactmap.
